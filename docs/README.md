## Installation

You must create a new [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this application.
I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and I recommend that you do the same. You
can follow the [PyCharm instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html) for creating a virtual environment for your project.
Open a terminal window in the virtual environment and enter

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You will see several information and warning messages, and you can ignore them. As long as
you did not get fatal errors, your installation worked.

## Running the Application

Follow the PyCharm instructions for running the application. You will see something that looks like
